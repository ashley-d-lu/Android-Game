# Android-Game :space_invader:

## About
  
This android app is a collaboration with three of my peers.

It allows users to register, log in, and log out. 
When logged in, the user can play through 4 mini-games, 
view their current and past game statistics, 
and compare their statistics with other users. 

## Goal

The goal of this project is to use design principles, 
design patterns, and packaging to make code that is clean and extensible.

This project follows Clean Architecture and MVC (Model, View,
Controller).

It features design patterns, such as Dependency Inversion, Singleton, Observer, 
Builder, Factory, and Strategy.
